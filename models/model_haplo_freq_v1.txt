# Using Dirichlet distribution, it determines parameters for
# haplotype frequencies - should be quite obvious ...
# 
# But this doesn't work so well. Note that Dirichlet distribution is not
# a friendly one when many outcomes are zeros... Changed to multinomial and
# it seems to work better. Note that multinomial parameters (ps) are not 
# normalized.
